# Sante_IoT_Watch
Epita's best IoT watch ; Theme : SPORTS &amp; GAMES

#How to use
You have 4 functionalities ordered from 1 to 4.
The Reaction Game requires you to hit enter when the GO mark appears. Beware, for a TRAP mark will halt your progress on higher levels!

The Memory Game requires you to remember a sequence of inputs, then to input them as fast as possible.

For these two games your reaction speed will be displayed in nanoseconds, so monitor your progress!

Then you got the Hour - Time display, as this is a watch ;)

And finally, the BPM monitor, to check your heart beat! The displayed cloud of points shows you every value picked up by the sensor, that way one can check the mathematics behind the calculations!

#SPOILERS!
If you know the Konami Code, you may input it at the end of every game to unlock harder levels!
Check the code to get the Konami code!
